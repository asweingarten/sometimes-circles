    <img src="./img/art.png" alt="">
    <p>In this post, I will explain the generative art techniques used to create Sometimes Circles. First, I will explain the math behind a single Sometimes Circle. Then I'll discuss stacking Sometimes Circles including size and position. </p>

    I saw these circles in a piece on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/generative/">/r/generative</a> and thought I could bang it out in an evening. It took more than an evening.

    <h2>One Sometimes-Circle</h2>

    <p>A sometimes-cirle is a list of arc lengths measured in degrees.
       Each arc length is uniformly sampled from the range [10, 160].
       Whether or not the first arc length is draw is decided by a fair coin flip (50/50 change) and then it alternates through the list.

    The color is uniformly selected from a list of three colors.

    <h2>
      Stacking Sometimes-Circles
    </h2>
    <img src="./img/stacked.png" alt="">
    <p>
       Sometimes-circles differ in their scale and their origins.
       Scales are uniformly samples between 1 and 10.
       The origin is modeled as sampling a "drift" on the X and Y axes.
       The drift along both axes are uniformly sampled between -0.1 and 0.5.

    <h2>
      Polka Dots
    </h2>
    <img src="img/polka-dots.png" alt="">
    <p>
       Slightly translucent polka dots are scattered across the image.
       They are scaled between 0.1 and 0.5.
       The origin is sampled in the same way as a sometimes-circle but with a different range.
       Uniform sampling is not ideal here because it heavily prefers the region with the circles intead of the corners
